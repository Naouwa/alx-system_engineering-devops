# Postmortem Report Project

## Overview

This project involves creating a detailed postmortem report for a fictional outage that occurred on June 20, 2024. The goal of the postmortem is to analyze the root cause of the outage, document the timeline of events, and propose corrective and preventative measures to avoid future incidents.

## Issue Summary

**Duration of the outage:**  
Start: June 20, 2024, 10:00 AM UTC  
End: June 20, 2024, 11:30 AM UTC  

**Impact:**  
The website was down for 1.5 hours. Approximately 50% of users couldn't access the site, leading to numerous customer complaints and a temporary suspension of transactions.

**Root Cause:**  
A misconfiguration in the web server settings limited the number of concurrent connections, causing the server to fail under increased traffic.

## Timeline

- **10:00 AM:** Monitoring alert detected high response times.
- **10:05 AM:** Engineer confirmed the issue by accessing the website.
- **10:10 AM:** Initial investigation focused on database performance.
- **10:20 AM:** Assumed database overload; attempted query optimizations.
- **10:40 AM:** No improvement; shifted focus to network performance.
- **11:00 AM:** Identified web server misconfiguration as the potential cause.
- **11:10 AM:** Escalated to senior engineer.
- **11:20 AM:** Corrected web server settings and restarted servers.
- **11:30 AM:** Service restored, normal operations resumed.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
The web server was configured to handle a limited number of concurrent connections. When traffic spiked, the server couldn't handle the load, resulting in downtime.

**Resolution:**  
Updated the web server settings to allow more concurrent connections by editing the configuration file and restarting the server to apply the changes.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes:**  
- Enhance server configuration to handle higher traffic loads.
- Improve monitoring to detect configuration issues early.
- Document and regularly review server settings.

**Tasks:**
1. **Patch Nginx server:** Update configuration to allow more concurrent connections.
2. **Add monitoring on server memory and connection limits:** Set up alerts for high memory usage and connection limits.
3. **Implement load testing:** Regularly perform load tests to ensure the server can handle traffic spikes.
4. **Review and document server configurations:** Create and maintain detailed documentation for server settings.
5. **Training for team members:** Conduct training sessions on managing server configurations and monitoring tools.

## Making the Postmortem Engaging

To make the postmortem more attractive and engaging, the following elements were added:

1. **Humorous Title:**  
   "Postmortem: Website Outage Due to Server Misconfiguration on June 20, 2024 - When Servers Say 'No More Traffic, Please!'"

2. **Humorous and Relatable Content:**  
   Added humor and relatable anecdotes to keep readers engaged.

3. **Visual Aids:**
   - **Server Outage Meme:** ![Server Outage Meme](https://www.example.com/server-outage-meme.png)
   - **Outage Timeline Diagram:** ![Outage Timeline Diagram](https://www.example.com/outage-timeline-diagram.png)

By incorporating these elements, the postmortem aims to be not only informative but also engaging and enjoyable to read.
